An example of Visualisation using the GUI
=======================================
In this section we have provided an easy step-by-step *Usage Example* of Visualisation with LIBTwinSVM.
For more information on the application and its features, go to this link. 

--------------------
 Step 1: Data Import
--------------------
To visualize a model, the first step is to import the data. In the following section, we have shown how to import data and how to use some of the application features.
 1. By default, the application starts on the Data tab.

 2. By clicking on the **Open** button in the **Import** box, the **File Explorer** will be open and you can then choose the file you want to train.

 3. We can choose the file content separator if it is other than **comma**. 
 4. In **Read** box in **Data** tab,  we can choose how we want the data to be processed by the application. We may want to **Normalize** or  **Shuffle** the data.
 5. Then we must click on **Load** Button, and the data will be imported and also displayed in the feature box.

 Step 2: Visualisation
----------------------
So far, the data must be already imported and we are going to see how **Visualize** tab works.
 1. We switch the tabs to **Visualize** tab.

 2. Now we have a bunch of options to choose or modify such as **Classifier**, **Kernel** type, **Hyper Parameters** and **DPI** which it determines the output plot quality.
 3. In the *Options* box in Visualize tab, there is a check-box for saving the figure. By checking that check-box, we need to select a path, so the application can save the final figure.

 4. In the final step by Clicking on the **Plot** button, the plot will be displayed in the figure box.
