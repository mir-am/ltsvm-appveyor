## Core Features
LIBTwinSVM is an easy-to-use implementation of Twin Support Vector Machine.  It is licensed under the terms of GNU GPL v3. This application comes with a user interface which makes using the algorithm so handy for Data Scientists, Machine Learning Researchers and whoever else that is interested in Machine Learning.
<br>

- A **simple** and **user-friendly Graphical User Interface** (GUI).
- Supports both **standard TwinSVM** and **Least Squares TwinSVM** classifiers.
- Easy to import data in **CSV** & **LIBSVM** format.
- A dataset can be loaded with **shuffling** and **normalization**.
- A **fast optimizer** (clipDCD) is improved and implemented in C++ to solve optimization problems of TwinSVMs.
- Supports **Linear**, **RBF** and **Rectangular** kernel.
- Supports **Binary** and **Multi-class** classification (One-vs-All & One-vs-One).
- The OVA and OVO estimators are **compatible with scikit-learn** tools such as GridSearchCV, cross_val_score, etc.
- A classifier can be evaluated using either **K-fold cross-validation** or **Training/Test split**.
- Supports **grid search** over estimators' hyper-parameters.
- The detailed classification results can be saved in an **Excel-format spreadsheet** file.
- The classification results can be logged during the grid search process to not lose results in case of power failure.
- A **feature-rich visualization tool** to show decision boundaries and geometrical interpretation of TwinSVMs.
- The best-fitted classifier can be saved on the disk after the grid search process.
- The pre-trained models can be loaded and evaluated on the test samples.

### Installation from the source

**1.  Downloading LIBTWinSVM**

First, make sure that [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed as it is required for getting the source code. Then open Git in any arbitrary path and enter the following command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mir-am/LIBTwinSVM
```

**2. Downloading Requirements**

Before installing any packages, we recommend you to upgrade pip:

* Linux & Mac OS:
```python
pip3 install -U pip
```
* Windows:
```python
pip install -U pip
```

For LIBTwinSVM installation, *Numpy* and *Cython* must be installed. You can install them by entering the following commands in your terminal. If you already have *Cython* and *Numpy* installed, you can skip to the next section.

* Linux & Mac OS: For installing Numpy & Cython on your computer, you should enter the following command in the terminal.
```
pip3 install numpy cython
```

* Windows: for installing the requirements on windows, you should enter the following command in the command prompt. 
```
pip install numpy cython
```

**3. Installing LIBTwinSVM**

Go to LIBTwinSVM folder where you have downloaded the source code in step 2. Then enter the following command in the terminal:

* Linux & Mac OS:
```python
pip3 install .
```
* Windows:
```python
pip install .
```

## Quick start

After LIBTwinSVM was installed, for running the GUI application, open the terminal and enter the following code:
* Linux & Mac OS:
```python
python3 -m libtsvm
```
* Windows:
```python
python -m libtsvm
```
